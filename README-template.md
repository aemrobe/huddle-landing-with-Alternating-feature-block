### Useful resources

- [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) - This helped me to get the value for the properties of my elements(margin padding font-size and others) by comparing with the design image which is given in the design folder
